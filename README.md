# plotter.js

## Overview

This is a minimal frills JavaScript canvas numerical data plotting package.

## Features currently lacking (but planned)

- axes with tick marks
  - manually computed and labeled
  - automatically computed
- text labels

## Validation

We include a sanity checking plotter-test.html file. This demostrates:

- binding the plotter to a canvas element
- lines with clipping
- x and y error bar markers
- bounding box computation
